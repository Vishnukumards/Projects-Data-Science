# The Spark Foundation - Graduate Rotational Internship Program Projects

This repository contains the projects completed during my Graduate Rotational Internship Program at The Spark Foundation. Each project focuses on different aspects of data science and machine learning.

## Project 1: Student Score Prediction

- **Topic**: Supervised Learning - Linear Regression
- **Description**: Predicted student scores using supervised machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression.
- **Tools/Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Project 2: Iris Flower Clustering

- **Topic**: Unsupervised Learning - Clustering
- **Description**: Imported the Iris dataset and predicted the optimum number of clusters using unsupervised learning techniques. The results were represented visually.
- **Tools/Technologies**: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project 3: EDA on Sample Store Dataset

- **Topic**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Description**: Performed exploratory data analysis on a sample store dataset to identify areas where profits could be increased.
- **Tools/Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project 4: EDA on Global Terrorism Dataset

- **Topic**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Description**: Conducted exploratory data analysis on the Global Terrorism dataset to identify areas with higher incidents of terrorism.
- **Tools/Technologies**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## Project 5: EDA on Sports Winning Probability
