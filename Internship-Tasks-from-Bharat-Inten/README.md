ðŸš€ Exciting Developments in Data Science at Bharat Intern ðŸ“ˆ

# Bharat Intern Data Science Virtual Internship

This repository contains the projects I completed during my virtual internship in Data Science at Bharat Intern. The internship focused on practical applications of data science techniques, with a particular emphasis on stock price prediction.

## Project 1 : Stock Price Prediction

###  Apple Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

In this project, I developed a model to predict the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network well-suited for sequence prediction problems.

#### Key Features:
- Data collection and preprocessing of Apple's historical stock data
- Implementation of LSTM model using Python and relevant libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, Keras)
- Training the model on historical data to predict future stock prices
- Evaluation of model performance and visualization of results



## Project 2: Titanic Classification

### Task 2: Predicting Survival in the Titanic Disaster

In this project, I used machine learning algorithms to predict which passengers were likely to survive the Titanic disaster based on their demographic and travel information.

#### Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms:
	+ Logistic Regression
	+ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
	+ Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
	+ Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall

  
## Project 3: Handwritten Digit Recognition

### Task 3: Number Recognition using MNIST Dataset

In this project, I developed a model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

#### Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and feature extraction
- Implementation of a deep learning model for handwritten digit recognition
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy and loss


#### Technologies Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for development and documentation
